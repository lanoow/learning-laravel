# Learning Laravel
All of the knowledge has been gained from [this Tutorial](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-8-from-scratch/) -> The best tutorial ever!

## Preparation
1. Choose an IDE to code in, I personally like **Visual Studio Code**
2. Configure it to your preference
3. If you're using **VS Code**, here are my **TOP** extensions for **Laravel**:
	* [Laravel Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=onecentlin.laravel-extension-pack) -> Provides very useful extensions for **Laravel**
	
## Installation
I personally chose to install **Laravel** with **Composer** because I think it's the best choice for me

	$ composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
	$ cd example-app
	$ php artisan serve
---
But I also installed and the **Laravel Installer** just in case I need it

	$ composer global require laravel/installer
	$ laravel new example-app
	$ cd example-app
	$ php artisan serve	

**Note:** I didn't include `.env` so make sure to create a `.env` file from the `.env.example` file.
